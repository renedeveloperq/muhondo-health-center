    <p>Welcome to Muhondo Health Center's laboratory services. Below is a comprehensive list of laboratory tests we offer to help diagnose and manage various health conditions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Complete Blood Count (CBC):</strong> This test measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. It helps diagnose conditions such as anemia, infections, and blood disorders.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP):</strong> The BMP test measures various components in the blood, including glucose, calcium, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), and kidney function markers (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen). It aids in assessing overall health and detecting conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lipid Panel:</strong> This test measures cholesterol levels in the blood, including total cholesterol, HDL (good cholesterol), LDL (bad cholesterol), and triglycerides. It helps evaluate the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Liver Function Tests (LFTs):</strong> LFTs assess the health and function of the liver by measuring enzymes, proteins, and bilirubin levels in the blood. They aid in diagnosing liver diseases such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fatty liver disease.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs):</strong> TFTs measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). They help diagnose thyroid disorders such as hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and thyroid nodules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Urinalysis:</strong> This test examines the physical and chemical properties of urine, including its color, clarity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, and the presence of blood cells or bacteria. It aids in diagnosing urinary tract infections, kidney diseases, and diabetes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stool Analysis:</strong> Stool analysis examines stool samples for the presence of blood, parasites, bacteria, and other abnormalities. It helps diagnose gastrointestinal conditions such as infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption syndromes.
        </li>
    </ul>
